# Homemade-Webcam

When I realized that I needed a webcam for my computer, instead
of wasting money on buying a new one, I decided to build one
using a old laptop webcam.

As of Friday January 20, 2023, the webcam is currently my main
webcam and is mounted on a movable light on my desk.

as of Saturday October 21, 2023, the webcam remains functional
