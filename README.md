# Homemade-Webcam

When I realized that I needed a webcam for my computer, instead
of wasting money on buying a new one, I decided to build one
using a old laptop webcam.

This was completed using a soldering iron, wire strippers, and duct tape.

webcam and is mounted on a movable light on my desk.
